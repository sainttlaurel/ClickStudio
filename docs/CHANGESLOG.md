# ClickStudio Changelog

All notable changes to ClickStudio are documented here.

## v1.8.0 (June 29, 2026)

### Added
* Photo compositing — filters, stickers, text, and frames are now baked into the saved image via `utils/bakeEdits.ts`
* Frame overlay rendering — Canvas now displays frame overlays visually (Film, Blush, Minimal, Polaroid)
* `bakePhotoEdits` utility — composites image + adjustments + CSS filter + emoji stickers + text overlays + frame overlay onto a canvas, returns baked data URL
* StickersPanel pack switching — 160 emojis across 10 themed packs with tab selector
* Lazy loading — all secondary pages now code-split via `React.lazy`, main bundle reduced to 621KB

### Fixed
* **Adjustment sliders now bake into saved image** — brightness, contrast, saturation, exposure, highlights, shadows, temperature, tint are all composited via `adjustmentsToCss()` in `bakeEdits.ts`
* Save now preserves all edits — adjustments + filters + stickers + text + frames are composited before storing
* `text-text` (44 occurrences) replaced with `text-foreground` — these were silently ignored no-op Tailwind classes
* `surface` color (`#FFFFFF`) added to Tailwind config — `bg-surface` now resolves properly
* Dead code removed: `sounds.ts` (39 lines), `pdf.ts` (195 lines), `TemplateLibrary.tsx` (376 lines), `qrcode` + `jspdf` npm packages (45 packages removed)
* Duplicate `bakeFrameOverlay` removed — `bakeEdits.ts` now imports from `frameOverlay.ts`
* `handleBack` from preview screen now correctly returns to edit mode without corrupting state
* Supabase env vars: app no longer crashes at startup if vars are missing — warns instead, creates client lazily
* `bg-rose-50` → `bg-secondary`, `hover:bg-rose-50` → `hover:bg-secondary` in Header and Sidebar
* AdjustPanel — labels match actual adjustment keys, added missing temperature/tint sliders, switched from local to controlled state
* FiltersPanel — imports from constants with data-driven `thumbColor`, `90s` filter no longer missing
* StickersPanel — imports `STICKER_PACKS` instead of hardcoded 16 emojis
* FramesPanel — uses matching IDs from `@/constants/frames`
* CaptureScreen — countdown (3s), flash effect, color swatches now tint viewport
* SharePage: `sessionId` undefined now shows error instead of infinite loading
* GalleryPage: `handleShare` type fixed from `any` to `Photo`
* AboutPage: version now reads from `APP_VERSION` constant (was hardcoded `1.7.8`)
* Changelog constant added to `constants/index.ts` barrel export
* `text-text` (44 occurrences) replaced with `text-foreground` across old layout pages
* LandingPage "Start the Studio" links directly to `/studio`
* Sidebar nav: Camera→Studio, Preview→Gallery, Editor→History
* Raw `<svg>` replaced with `lucide-react` icons in PhotoBoothEditor sidebar nav and BottomTabs (8 icons) — removes 2KB of inline SVG strings
* `#EC1A66` hardcoded color replaced with `studio` Tailwind color token across all 11 photobooth components — centralized color management
* **Frame live preview on camera** — CaptureScreen now shows frame overlay on camera viewport with frame selector row (Clean, Film, Blush, Minimal, Polaroid); selected frame carries through to editor after capture
* **Realistic frame visuals** — Film (10% black bars + repeating sprocket holes), Blush (stronger gradient + corner sparkles + inner border), Minimal (thick white border + soft shadow + corner accents), Polaroid (thick white frame + outer shadow + serif caption); aligned `bakeFrameOverlay` canvas version to match CSS overlays
* **Frame-specific aspect ratios** — `frames.ts` now includes `aspectRatio` per frame (Film: 3/2 landscape, Blush: 4/5 portrait, Polaroid: 4/5 portrait, Clean/Minimal: 1/1) — `getFrameAspectRatio()` and `calcFrameHeight()` utilities drive dynamic sizing
* **Frame library connected** — `TEMPLATE_LIBRARY` (28 templates, 9 with PNG frame backgrounds) now accessible via `TemplatePicker` modal on camera screen; selecting a template sets frame style + aspect ratio + frameImage
* **TemplatePicker component** — modal with category filter + grid of templates showing emoji, name, description, layout, aspect ratio, badges
* **PNG frame template compositing** — `FrameOverlay` renders `frameImage` as `<img>` overlay on camera + canvas; `bakeEdits` loads and composites PNG frame background with photo on top
* **Dynamic frame-to-template mapping** — templates with CSS compositeStyle (clean/polaroid/film/blush/minimal) use existing CSS frames; templates with `compositeStyle: 'frame'` use PNG image; switching between CSS frames and templates clears the other
* Duplicate emoji removed from sticker packs; `墨镜` replaced with emoji
* Date formatting standardized to `en-US` locale
* Breadcrumb text simplified (removed confusing "Preview ›" prefix)
* Text shadow extended to all light colors (gold, pink, lime, cyan)

### Changed
* Bundle size: ~672KB → ~621KB (react-query, qrcode, jspdf removed; lazy loading added)
* Supabase client: lazy initialization via `getClient()`, no crash on missing env vars
* PhotoBoothEditor — centralized state management, fixed undo stack closure issue
